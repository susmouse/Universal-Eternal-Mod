Kane Heller

Not much is know about this individual, we don't even have a skin color or a hair color to assign him.
Only that he wares a power armor suit that resembles our heavy UAC marines.
Other then a few blood samples located in few places.
This only proves that he is barely human.
We have a few recording of him he speaks some form of english and sounds male, for now he is assigned as male.
He is even somehow put in our data bases with a fake name.
Also having his name in public databases gets replaced always at somepoint.

He seems to "help" at somepoints, saving some marines lives when they were facing certain death.



////////////////////////////////////WEAPONS



//////////////////CHAINSAW REPLACER

BFH-001 Thermal Decimator, BFG powered war hammer

originally designed and built by the mad men in the BFG division, It never got past the early prototypes.
The Hell Crusher was created for the express use in power armored units due to it's huge size and incredibly hot blast, 
the power armor suits could easily handle the heat of the blast and wield it's incredibly heavy weight.


//////////////////PISTOLS

EX-264 Executioner Hand Cannon, half railgun, half hand cannon

The commission was submitted by Kane Heller (Hell Crusher guy) to the "company," to design it for him,
It was designed for the express use of *only* Kane Heller and the plans stored in a encrypted drive on his person.
For if he loses it, he can easily make another.

A huge hand cannon designed for big hands and a strong user, It is chambered in 50 Beowulf.
It is Perfectly accurate all the time due to integrated railgun tech. Despite having a detachable magazine
it doesn't need to be reloaded by Kane Heller due to his multidimensional storage drive.



EX-91 Black Talons, dual full auto magnum caliber handguns

An early version of executioner, just tweaked with a full auto in mind.
They are with out the railgun system found in the newer versions of the Executioner,
Meaning less accuracy. Plus they come with a alt-fire where the 
fire rate can be almost tripled for each one.



EMG-754 Infinity Magnum, Infinite ammo death dealer

Condensing energy into a physical projectile was always theorized as possibility.
The "company" has achieved this much earlier then the UAC did, as this weapon
doesn't even need an energy source, and it is the size of large handgun.



Boom Stick, Double barrel shotgun

Pretty much a decently decorated double barrel shotgun.
Except it is 4 gauge. And only has one trigger,
you can only shoot both barrels.



KCRV-59 Mammoth Tusk, kinetically charged 700 nitro express revolver

A huge revolver made out of a nano robotic material that can hold a kinetic charge.
Spinning or moving the weapon around quickly can charge it up for increased projectile force.
It's huge frame and grip was made for Kane Heller massive stature in mind, 
though certain UAC made sets of power armor could easily wield it.



//////////////////SHOTGUNS

BFSG-23 Jack Hammer Blunderbuss, dual-mode 4 gauge shotgun

dynamic full auto shotgun, chambered in 4 gauge shells.
It is able to switch fire rates on the fly.
Can also be switched into a pump action with ease.


1878 coach gun "Devil's Cry"
retrieval location: Phobos Anomaly, Mars
retrieval date:
misplace date:


Description: A Strange unmarked weapon, with no weapon identification number.
Which It most closely resembles a break action shotgun or coach gun.
Running it through various radiometric dating methods puts it at a little over 157 years old.
measuring out the gauge of one barrels puts it at 4 gauge, exact.
even more bizarre is that it has maxillary and mandibular that run in betwixt each barrel set,
they resemble human teeth, but are not exact. the teeth are constantly moist with a almost saliva like substance.
it is also adorned a with a skull right behind the breach that occasionally "blinks."
some tests and incidents may have proven the weapon to be alive and sentient.

This weapon only has two triggers, the first one for all the barrels,
A strange and deadly design descension for its user. And the second one for a "enhanced mode,"
once pulling it back slowly starts to fully awaken skull causing it to flare up in crimson fire and sparks.
The gun begins to emit a "screaming" sound and releasing the trigger causes it to uncharge.
Pulling the first trigger with out fully releasing the second one causes the gun to expel crimson fire and sparks and more ballistic projectiles.
Breaking the gun open after reveals that the casing, wad, shot and primer are all missing,
presumed turned into the extra projectile. leaving only the metal base.

incident-001: Dr. Porter described feeling a bizarre mental pull to the weapon during a break,
even experiencing auditory hallucinations, he found him self walking all the way to the containment vessel the weapon was stored in,
opening it up, only to have all the stimulus vanish on the spot.
He described hearing wisphers, the wisphers echoing thoughts of hunger an starvation.

let alone its altnate fire mode's 10,500 rpm...



HRC-703 Apocalypse Killer, 30mm railgun assault rifle

Upscaled assault rifle that fires 30mm solid titanium iron alloy slugs.
It has a feeding system which builds the rounds while firing using nanomachines
to disassemble prexisting ammo at a molecular level. And then rebuild it into 
fresh rounds. the Apocalypse Killer also uses this system for a altnate fire mode
where it can build one long round the fill most of the barrel.
