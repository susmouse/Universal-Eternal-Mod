This is my first MOD, which aims to recreate Doom Eternal's mechanics in ClassicDoom while maintaining compatibility with custom weapon packs and custom monster packs.

I'm not proficient in C#. This mod was created after just 10 minutes of reading the ZDoom wiki, based on [Hell Crusher](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=72084) and [Vanilla Glory Kill](https://github.com/OverDriver05/Vanilla-Glory-Kill), so please bear with any bugs you may encounter:
